## Welcome

Welcome to the **ClevrScan API documentation** ðŸ‘‹  

ClevrScan provides powerful APIs to help you **automate and optimize document processing**.  
You can build integrations, manage templates, analyze data, and connect ClevrScan with your own systems.

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration).  
For this documentation, we are using the **OpenAPI specification**.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require **Bearer Token authentication**.  
Make sure to include your API key in the `Authorization` header when making requests.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
